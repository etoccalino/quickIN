TODO:
- prompt the user for the access token, then open the browser at "1/authorize" URL
  - use a browser agnostic approach
- store the token in the config file
- read/write from the config file in the user's home dir
  - write the token
  - write the list ID to make future fetches quicker
- automatically renew expired tokens
- wrap the trello functionality with FreeSimpleGUI (prototype in `p2.py`)
- allow for an optional description in the GUI
- better error handling of config read/write permissions
- exec the network calls in the background
- package the app
- QOL: provide a "board name" in the configs, to try to fetch the board ID.


To access the Trello API you need to create a "PowerUp". This involves accepting terms-of-use and adding some personal information. After that (one-time setup step), you can authorize the application to use the Trello API.

I'm using the "1/authorize" method, as described in https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/. This is handled by the `trello` python library (https://pypi.org/project/trello/) which is... ok.

I'll be storing the application config, including authorization/authentication, in a TOML file in the user home. This is the simplest form of database I can think of (to store authorization tokens) that can double as a configuration. This shall be handled by the `tomlkit` python library.
